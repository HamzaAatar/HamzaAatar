## 🙋‍♂️ About Me

### Hi there 👋
I'm a Python developer with a passion for automating tasks and scraping data. I love finding creative ways to save time and improve efficiency using the power of code. 💻

In my 5+ years of experience as a freelancer, I've worked on a variety of projects ranging from web scraping to data analysis to task automation. I'm always up for a challenge and love learning new things. 🧑‍💼

When I'm not coding, you can find me binge-watching sci-fi movies, playing video games, or tinkering with new tech gadgets. 🎮🤖

Feel free to check out my projects and say hi! 👋
